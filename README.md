Skeleton project that makes it easy to work with:

- gulp.js
- ES6 (via traceur)
- SASS
- D3

Basic gulpfile is already set up to watch for changes to SCSS and JS
files and to use livereload to automagically refresh view in browser. Meant
to be cloned, then modified for particular project. Requires gulp.js.


This started out as a copy of the basic project constructed in tagtree.tv's
"optimal D3 environment" [screencast](http://tagtree.tv/d3-episode1-environment)

Found via the excellent [build-podcast](http://build-podcast.com/gulp) gulp
episode.
